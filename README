DESCRIPTION

That playbooks where tested with ansible 2.9.6 on AWS environment on virtual machines AWS 2

To get started aws keys should be changed in group_vars/all/creds.yml vault files
The ssh public key should be also included in same vault file.
The vault password is the email address I have received that task from.

This is the way how I executed the playbooks.
# ansible-playbook -vv web_vm_configure.yml -f 5 -u ec2-user --vault-password-file pwd

There playbooks should be executed in appropriate order:

1. db_vm_create.yml - Initiating instance on aws for DB needs.
2. db_vm_configure.yml - Installing percona 8 and adding requrid users to the DB.
3. web_vm_create.yml - Initiation instance on aws for WEB needs.
4. web_vm_configure.yml - Installation of Web services and PhpMyAdmin, configuring firewall to allow only WEB server to DB.

It was tested on AWS free account which have some limitations, so that setup in production would look different.
Of course that playbook is raw and there are a lot of things to be added.
